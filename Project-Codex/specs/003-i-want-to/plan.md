# Implementation Plan: 003-i-want-to

**Branch**: `[003-i-want-to]` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: `/specs/003-i-want-to/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Deliver a minimal, dark-themed, responsive web application with a noisy radial gradient (black → cherry red, top-center origin). The landing flow is: Introduction → Ideals → Projects. Use Next.js (App Router) with dynamic site configuration and connect to Supabase project "Project-Codex" for content storage. On mobile, use a bottom tab bar with 3–4 items; include a prominent "Learn About Me" CTA.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript, Next.js 14+ (App Router)
**Primary Dependencies**: next, react, react-dom, @supabase/supabase-js, next-themes, tailwindcss (or CSS Modules)
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) — project: "Project-Codex"
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (unit), Playwright (e2e), Contract tests for API schemas
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop & mobile responsive)
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js frontend with minimal API routes)
**Performance Goals**: P95 < 200ms for cached pages; images lazy-loaded; Core Web Vitals good
**Constraints**: Dark mode by default; accessible contrast; reduced-motion compliant; English only
**Scale/Scope**: Personal site scale; low concurrency; deploy to Vercel or similar

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Modular monolith and clear contracts: Single Next.js app with typed API routes and OpenAPI spec → OK
- API-first with JSON and OpenAPI: Provide read-only endpoints for public content → OK
- Security & Auth: Public read-only; prepare RBAC for future admin; secrets via env → OK
- Test-first: Include unit/integration/contract tests in plan → OK
- Observability: Structured logs in API routes; health endpoint optional → OK
- Simplicity: Avoid microservices; use built-in Next.js features → OK

Result: PASS (no unjustified violations)

**Structure Decision**: Web application — Single Next.js app in `frontend/` with API routes for minimal backend needs.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Unknowns → resolved in research.md (styling approach, data fetching mode, dynamic config, auth posture)
- Dependencies → Next.js + Supabase integration best practices
- Integration → Supabase RLS for public read; anon client for client-side reads or SSR with anon key

Output: `research.md` generated with decisions, alternatives, and risks.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- `data-model.md` → Entities: Person, Principle, Project, Tag, ProjectTag, NavItem, ThemeConfig, SiteSettings
- `contracts/` → Public read-only endpoints returning JSON; future admin endpoints out of scope
- `quickstart.md` → Setup Next.js, env vars for Supabase, run/test instructions

Output: `data-model.md`, `contracts/openapi.yaml`, `quickstart.md` generated.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (for /tasks)
This plan defers actual task file creation to the `/tasks` command. Strategy:
- Derive tasks from contracts (contract tests first), data model, and user scenarios
- TDD order: tests before implementation; dependency order respected (models → services → UI)
- Mark independent tasks as [P] for parallelization

## Complexity Tracking
(none at this time)

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
