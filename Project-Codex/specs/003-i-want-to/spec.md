# Feature Specification: Design Ideology ‚Äî Simple, Minimal, Dark Mode Codex

**Feature Branch**: `[003-i-want-to]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to update the specifications with the design ideology for the entire web application. I want the entire web application to be simple, minimalistic, easy to understand. It should be in dark mode with the primary theme being a noisy radial gradient transition from black to cherry red from top to bottom with the center of the gradient being at the top center. It should have a landing page where it begins with an introduction about me followed by an explanation of my ideals and then my projects."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What‚Äôs the language scope for the site? ‚Üí A: English only (no i18n)
- Q: Navigation style on mobile? ‚Üí A: Bottom tab bar (3‚Äì4 items)
- Q: Projects list density on mobile? ‚Üí A: Single-column rich cards
- Q: Project detail page content priority? ‚Üí A: Artifact-first (screenshots/media at top)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I immediately understand the essence of the creator through a minimal, dark-themed landing experience that starts with a personal introduction, followed by a clear articulation of ideals (principles), and then curated projects.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a first-time visitor, When they load the home page, Then they see a clean dark interface with a subtle noisy radial gradient (black to cherry red, top-center origin) and concise introductory text.
2. Given a visitor on the landing page, When they scroll or navigate, Then the next section presents the creator‚Äôs ideals in simple language with clear hierarchy.
3. Given a visitor on the landing page after ideals, When they proceed, Then the projects section displays curated work cards with short descriptions and accessible deep links to detail pages.
4. Given a visitor on any page, When they look for navigation, Then a minimal, consistent navigation presents clear paths (Home, Ideals, Projects) without visual clutter.
5. Given a visitor with accessibility needs, When they use the interface, Then contrast ratios, font sizes, and focus states ensure readability and keyboard navigation.
6. Given a visitor who toggles the theme, When they select light mode, Then the entire UI switches to a light theme consistently and the preference persists on revisit.
7. Given a visitor with reduced motion preference, When they load the landing page, Then animations are minimized or disabled and no parallax-heavy effects are shown.
8. Given a visitor using a non-English device locale, When they visit the site, Then all UI and content remain in English and no language switcher is shown.
9. Given a visitor on a phone-width viewport, When they navigate the site, Then a bottom tab bar displays 3‚Äì4 labeled items (Home, Ideals, Projects, [More/Overflow if needed]) and allows switching sections with a single tap.
10. Given more than 4 primary sections in the future, When viewed on mobile, Then excess items are accessible via a single "More" tab in the bottom bar to preserve simplicity.
11. Given a visitor on a phone-width viewport viewing the Projects section, When they scroll the list, Then projects appear as single-column rich cards with title, short description, key tags, and a primary action link.
12. Given a visitor opening a project detail page, When the page loads, Then a hero artifact (screenshot/media) appears at the top, followed by a concise summary and then a clear ‚Äúwhy it exists‚Äù narrative.
13. Given a visitor on the landing page, When they look for the primary action, Then a prominent "Learn About Me" CTA is visible above the fold and navigates to the introduction/about section.

### Edge Cases
- What happens on very small screens? The layout should gracefully stack sections and maintain readability without losing the gradient‚Äôs intent.
- How does the gradient behave across high-DPI or color-managed displays? The visual should remain subtle and not overpower content.
- What if text overlays are unreadable on the gradient in some areas? Provide a content backdrop or adaptive text treatment for legibility.
- How does the theme adapt for printing or light-mode requests? The application supports an optional light mode via a user toggle (default is dark) and uses print-friendly styles (light background, high contrast) when printing.
- Device locales other than English: The site remains English; no locale-based auto-translation or language toggle is provided.
- Future growth of primary navigation: If primary sections exceed 4, use a single "More" overflow tab on mobile; desktop can display the full set with minimal top navigation.
- Projects list overflow: For very long project titles or descriptions, truncate with sensible ellipses and provide accessible expand/collapse on the detail page rather than in-list.
- Missing artifact media on project detail: If no media is available, show a neutral placeholder and elevate summary + ‚Äúwhy‚Äù content to the top; ensure accessible alt text for any displayed media.
- CTA visibility on small screens: Ensure "Learn About Me" CTA remains visible and focusable on initial load without being obscured by the bottom nav.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The application MUST present a dark mode theme by default across all pages.
- **FR-002**: The application MUST use a primary visual motif: a noisy radial gradient transitioning from black to cherry red from top to bottom, centered at the top-center of the viewport.
- **FR-003**: The landing page MUST begin with an introduction about the creator, followed by an explanation of ideals, and then a projects showcase.
- **FR-004**: The application MUST maintain a minimalistic, uncluttered layout with clear typographic hierarchy and generous spacing.
- **FR-005**: The navigation MUST be simple and consistent, offering direct access to Home, Ideals, and Projects (and any future essential sections) without distracting elements.
- **FR-006**: The design MUST prioritize readability and accessibility (sufficient contrast, scalable fonts, visible focus states, keyboard navigation).
- **FR-007**: The visual theme MUST be consistent across pages, including detail pages for projects and ideals.
- **FR-008**: The landing flow MUST clearly indicate progression: Introduction ‚Üí Ideals ‚Üí Projects, with smooth transitions that do not distract from content.
- **FR-009**: The theme MUST degrade gracefully on devices/browsers that do not support complex visuals; content remains primary.
- **FR-010**: The interface MUST be easy to understand, minimizing jargon and using concise, plain language for headings and descriptions.

### Clarified Decisions (formerly ambiguities)
- **FR-011**: The theme MUST offer a user-toggle for a light mode; dark mode remains the default. The user‚Äôs choice MUST persist across sessions.
- **FR-012**: The projects section MUST include optional filtering by tag/category and sorting by recency.
- **FR-013**: The landing page MUST include subtle motion that respects reduced-motion preferences and avoids distraction (e.g., durations ‚â§ 500ms; opacity/transform only; no parallax-heavy effects).
- **FR-014**: Typography MUST use Montserrat (or similar geometric sans-serif) for headings and Playfair Display (or similar serif) for body text; base size ‚â• 16px with readable line length (~60‚Äì80ch) and accessible contrast; provide sensible fallbacks.
- **FR-015**: Tone of voice MUST be friendly and personal‚Äîconcise, plain language in first-person where appropriate.
- **FR-016**: Language scope MUST be English-only; UI and content remain in English, and no language switcher is provided.
- **FR-017**: Mobile navigation MUST use a bottom tab bar with 3‚Äì4 primary items (default: Home, Ideals, Projects, [More if needed]); additional sections go under a single overflow tab on mobile.
- **FR-018**: On mobile, the Projects list MUST use single-column rich cards including: title, short description, key tags, and a primary action; thumbnails are optional and must not impede readability.
- **FR-019**: Project detail pages MUST prioritize artifact-first layout: hero media at the top, followed by a concise summary and then the ‚Äúwhy it exists‚Äù narrative; if media is absent, show a neutral placeholder and elevate text content.
- **FR-020**: The landing page MUST present a primary "Learn About Me" CTA above the fold; secondary links to Ideals and Projects are available but visually subordinate.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Landing Content**: Introduction, Ideals summary, Projects summary (copy and structure). Attributes: title, body, order, visibility.
- **Theme**: Visual tokens for color, spacing, typography, component density. Attributes: dark palette, gradient parameters, elevation, states.
- **Navigation Model**: Primary sections and their order. Attributes: label, path, visibility.
