# Feature Specification: Project Codex ‚Äî The Living Manuscript

**Feature Branch**: `[002-project-codex-is]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Project Codex is my ongoing attempt to translate a human soul into something the world can read. In ancient times, a codex was more than just a book ‚Äî it was a vessel of knowledge, a record of identity, a declaration that ideas were worth preserving. This project is my modern version of that. Not as a r√©sum√© or portfolio, but as a living manuscript of who I am ‚Äî my work, my principles, my contradictions, my growth. It isn‚Äôt meant to be finished. It is meant to evolve, page by page, as I do. Project Codex is not about being understood perfectly ‚Äî it is about being documented truthfully, so that anyone who stumbles upon it won‚Äôt just see what I‚Äôve done, but why I exist."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A person discovers Project Codex and experiences it as a living manuscript that documents the creator‚Äôs identity, values, work, and growth over time. The user can explore curated ‚Äúpages‚Äù representing facets of self (principles, works, contradictions, reflections) and understand not only what was done but why it exists.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a visitor on the home page, When they navigate to a "Principles" page, Then they see a clear list of principles with plain-language explanations and links to examples.
2. Given a visitor on a "Works" page, When they open an individual work, Then the page presents context (motivation, intent, process), the artifact itself (preview or link), and the "why" behind it.
3. Given a visitor, When they switch to a "Timeline" or "Changelog" view, Then they can see the project evolve (entries grouped by date with summaries of changes or growth moments).
4. Given a visitor on a "Contradictions" section, When they open an entry, Then they can read a self-honest statement and any follow-up learnings or course corrections.
5. Given any content page, When the visitor looks for authenticity markers, Then the page displays provenance (authored by, date, last updated) and any related reflections.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when content is missing or not yet written for a section? The system should gracefully indicate "page forthcoming" with optional subscription/notification.
- How does the system handle sensitive or deeply personal content? Provide content-level visibility (public/private/unlisted) and an editorial warning mechanism.
- How are contradictory or evolving statements handled? Preserve history and show evolution context without overwriting past entries.
- What if the same work fits multiple facets (principle and work)? Allow cross-linking and multi-facet tagging while preventing duplication/confusion.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST present curated sections: Principles, Works, Contradictions, Reflections, Timeline/Changelog.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow browsing and deep-linking to any page or entry.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST attach a "why it exists" narrative to each entry (context/motivation/intent).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST display provenance on every entry (author, created date, last updated).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST support content evolution with version history visible to readers (timeline of changes or reflections).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST support content visibility controls (public, private, unlisted) to manage sensitivity.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support cross-linking across facets (e.g., a Principle linking to related Works and Reflections).
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide search or guided navigation to help discovery across the manuscript.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide an authenticity/intent signal (short statement of purpose on relevant pages).
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide a "page forthcoming" state for under-construction content.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST allow adding new pages/entries without breaking existing links.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide an index/overview page that explains the project and how to explore it.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST maintain a changelog/timeline page that chronicles updates and growth moments.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST support tagging facets and filtering by tags or facets.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST support reader context: define who this is for and what they‚Äôll take away from sections.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST clearly distinguish between artifact and reflection (what vs. why) on each entry page.
- **FR-017**: The system SHOULD allow optional subscription or notification for new pages/updates. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: desired channels]

*Ambiguities to confirm:*
- **FR-018**: The system MUST authenticate contributors via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: who can author/edit? solo creator vs. collaborators?]
- **FR-019**: The system MUST define visibility defaults per section [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which sections default to public vs. private?]
- **FR-020**: The system MUST define content retention and deletion policy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retain revisions indefinitely or allow redaction?]
- **FR-021**: The system MUST define external link handling [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: embedded previews vs. outbound links only?]
- **FR-022**: The system MUST localize or remain single-language [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target audience language(s)?]
- **FR-023**: The system MUST define search scope [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: search all text vs. curated fields vs. tags only?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Manuscript Entry**: Represents a page or item (principle, work, contradiction, reflection). Attributes: title, slug, type (facet), narrative (why), body (what), tags, visibility, created/updated timestamps, relations to other entries.
- **Timeline Event**: A summarized change or growth moment. Attributes: date, summary, linked entries, type (addition, revision, reflection).
- **Facet**: A classification (Principle, Work, Contradiction, Reflection). Attributes: name, description, ordering; relation to entries.
- **Provenance**: Metadata for authenticity. Attributes: author, created date, last updated; optionally source links.
- **User (Contributor)**: A person who can author or edit. Attributes: identity, roles/permissions, profile (optional). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: roles?]
