<p align = 'justify'>
Project Codex is my ongoing attempt to translate a human soul into something the world can read. In ancient times, a codex was more than just a book — it was a vessel of knowledge, a record of identity, a declaration that ideas were worth preserving. This project is my modern version of that. Not as a résumé or portfolio, but as a living manuscript of who I am — my work, my principles, my contradictions, my growth. It isn’t meant to be finished. It is meant to evolve, page by page, as I do. Project Codex is not about being understood perfectly — it is about being documented truthfully, so that anyone who stumbles upon it won’t just see what I’ve done, but why I exist.
